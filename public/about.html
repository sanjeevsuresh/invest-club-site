        <h2 class="section-title">Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Berkeley Investment Group (BIG) is the largest and oldest investment club on campus with over 400 members and $130,000 under management. We seek to teach our members the skills needed to become a value investor through hands on portfolio management, educational programs, and exclusive networking opportunities. </p>

                <h2 class="section-title">For Students</h2>
                <p>The Berkeley Investment Group was founded in 1997 to address the lack of a community for students interested in investing. Since then, the Berkeley Investment Group has grown this community into multiple educational programs, weekly member meetings, and an officer corps that manages over $130,000. Learning how to invest is our core principle and our fund enables us to put our accumulated investing knowledge into practice. Our interest-driven culture has and will continue to supplement the refined, professional-grade curriculum and opportunities that we offer. There are multiple ways to get involved including: <a href="getInvolved.html#GeneralMembership">General Membership</a>, <a href="getInvolved.html#IntrotoWallStreet">Our Decal</a>, <a href="getInvolved.html#InternProgram">The Intern Program</a>, and <a href="teampage.html/#analysts">Being an Analyst</a>.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">For Investors</h2>
                <p>Our fund seeks to generate higher absolute and risk-adjusted returns than the MSCI All-Country World Index. We employ a flexible approach, investing in our best ideas across all countries, sectors, and market caps. Our focus is on fundamentally undervalued companies where our thesis is materially different from the market. We look for stocks where the market is missing something, causing the stock price to trade at less than its fair value. We consider not only on the potential upside of an investment, but also the potential downside. Our best ideas are those with asymmetric returns – high potential upside and low potential downside. To limit our downside, we look for businesses which have high barriers to entry and a competitive advantage in their industry.

                <p>Our alumini network spans 20 years worth of BIG analysts now working on the buy side, sell side, the tech industry, and in various other fields. BIG officers and members are able to leverage the alumni network for support, education, and career assistance. Alumni and current analysts get together in both New York and California for various events during the year.

                <h2 class="section-title">Our Members are Industry Ready</h2>
                <p>Between weekly interactions with industry professionals, our educational programs, and our officers' real-life application of value investing, our members are ready to take on any challenge presented to them in a workplace environment. Our general members are exposed to both the buy-side and the sell-side, have the opportunity to participate in various investment case competitions, and are provided with the resources to master value investing. Our officers have all spent a semester in an immersive investing course and upon completion are all active participants in managing capital, pitching ideas, and working with our investors. Because of this, BIG is <strong>the</strong> place to hire undergraduates for internships and full-time positions on both the buy-side and the sell-side.
